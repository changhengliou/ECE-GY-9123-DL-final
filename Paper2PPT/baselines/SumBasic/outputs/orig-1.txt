Refugees will not be housed in tents in Canada. The details of the plan will be announced Tuesday, but already Canadian officials have been working on the ground to process people. But sources also say the government will stay away from calling any of these temporary housing locations "camps" - perhaps to stay away from the notion that refugee camps are typically large-scale and temporary, often using tents. The total cost of the program is expected to be $1.2 billion over six years. But last week Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the process will be on top of what the United Nations is already doing. The vast majority of them will arrive in Toronto and Montreal. Sources tell CBC News that to deal with some ongoing concerns around security, unaccompanied men seeking asylum will not be part of the program. Canada's screening is being co-ordinated across departments, including the RCMP and CSIS. There had been some initial concerns about trying to "contain" refugees to any given location for too long, given that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees mobility rights. The price tag of such an ambitious plan over a short timeline is going to be significant.
