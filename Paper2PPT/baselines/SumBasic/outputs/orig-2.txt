Sheen said it was because he was depressed. Sheen's doctor, Robert Huizenga, told the program the actor did not have Aids. He said he had learned about the diagnosis "roughly four years ago", adding: "It's a hard three letters to absorb." An estimated 1.2 million people in the US have HIV. The actor's health status has been an open secret in Hollywood in recent weeks, since the showbusiness website Radar Online published a report about a Hollywood "megastar" being HIV positive. Today Show host Matt Lauer asked Sheen why he continued to bring people including prostitutes to his home even though they were threatening him. He posted a racist message about Barack Obama in March. Filming had been disrupted in the previous year as Sheen, who was the highest-paid actor on television at the time, received treatment for drug addiction. The actor said one incident of extortion took place when a prostitute took a picture of his antiretroviral medication and threatened to sell it. He most recently starred in the FX series Anger Management, which ran from June 2012 to December 2014.
