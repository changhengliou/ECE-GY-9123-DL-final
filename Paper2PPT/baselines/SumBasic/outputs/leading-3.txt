The government escalated its confrontation with Russia over the Crimea peninsula Monday, banning cargo trucks from entering the disputed region as activists blocked repairs to power-transmission lines. The Interior Ministry hasn't identified suspects in weekend blasts in the Kherson region in southern Ukraine that downed electricity pylons serving Crimea, leaving almost two million people without power. Ukraine's Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn told the Interfax news agency that explosives had been found at the power lines, preventing repair crews from working. Meanwhile, pro-Ukrainian activists-many of them from the minority Muslim community of Crimean Tatars-were blocking repair work to press their demands for a tougher line against Moscow. Ukrenergo, the national grid operator, held inconclusive talks Monday with activists in Chonhar, a village near the de facto border with Crimea close to one of four downed pylons. Ukrainian parliament member Mustafa Djemilev-a leader of the minority Muslim community of Crimean Tatars-said activists would only grant repair workers access to pylons that provide electricity to Ukrainian-held territory. The Crimean Tatars, who were persecuted during the Soviet era, opposed Russia's annexation of the peninsula last year. The activists have staked out the border between mainland Ukraine and Crimea since September, attempting to stop commercial trucks from crossing. The Ukrainian government responded Monday by imposing a temporary ban on trucks ferrying goods to and from Crimea. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk asked his cabinet to formalize the decree by drafting a law that would "take into account the interests of our brotherly Crimean Tatar people."
