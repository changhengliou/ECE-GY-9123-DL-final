But at the same time, I can't write a sad record, like, for everyone else. In fact, the reason 21 is so good is that Adele leans into different styles that flatter her voice just as much as the soaring belt she lets loose in 19's "Chasing Pavements," 21's "Someone Like You," and 25's "Hello." While there are a few standout songs, the tracks begin to blend together by the latter half of the album - or maybe they just become more expected, more routine. ... As Brooklyn Magazine's White says, "['Sweetest Devotion'] encapsulates what the entirety of 25 could've been. And so she became the patron saint of heartbreak. That 25 only briefly visits new emotional territory is disappointing, because Adele has proven that she knows how to wade through the muck of emotions, the ambiguities of overall ache, to find some moment or emotional clarity worth crystallizing. But when talking about 25, Adele was quick to shut down the idea that she would keep singing the same kinds of songs about the same kinds of pain. And then it begins to repeat, and repeat, and repeat, until it finally gives up the race and just fades away, as if exhausted by trying. And the most frustrating thing about these songs is that Adele's voice is as strong as ever, but the tracks build in such predictable ways that she almost sounds ordinary.
