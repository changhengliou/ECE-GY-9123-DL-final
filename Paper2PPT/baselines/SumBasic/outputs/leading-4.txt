By the time I finished listening to 25, Adele's first new album in almost five years, I'd completely forgotten that I'd been listening to it. While there are a few standout songs, the tracks begin to blend together by the latter half of the album - or maybe they just become more expected, more routine. Aside from a couple of percussive stabs at doing something different, 25 is so focused on serving up heavy helpings of Adele's gigantic voice that it rarely goes anywhere new - or even particularly interesting. The album might move you, but it will rarely surprise you. After teasing that 25 wouldn't - and couldn't - be all heartbreak all the time, Adele still spends most of the album wallowing

The singer's first album, 2008's 19, was a heartfelt and brilliant debut, but 21 (2011) was on another level entirely, as she tore through her rage and grief in tones both clipped and soaring. Adele collected the wreckage of a tumultuous relationship, mourned it, and then set it ablaze. And so she became the patron saint of heartbreak. Her devastating ballad "Someone Like You" became a go-to anthem for every shade of sadness, perhaps best summarized in the simplistic - but spot-on -Saturday Night Live sketch that quickly devolves into everyone bawling their eyes out. But when talking about 25, Adele was quick to shut down the idea that she would keep singing the same kinds of songs about the same kinds of pain. "I don't think the record has a vibe of 'Whoo-hoo, I'm totally happy!'"
