"Crimea is Ukrainian territory. The Crimean Tatars, who were persecuted during the Soviet era, opposed Russia's annexation of the peninsula last year. Crimea receives 85% of its water and 80% of its electricity from mainland Ukraine. "The situation in Crimea is difficult but not catastrophic," said deputy government chairman Dmitry Kozak. Ukraine's Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn told the Interfax news agency that explosives had been found at the power lines, preventing repair crews from working. Local officials were less sanguine. Ukrainian parliament member Mustafa Djemilev-a leader of the minority Muslim community of Crimean Tatars-said activists would only grant repair workers access to pylons that provide electricity to Ukrainian-held territory. The Interior Ministry hasn't identified suspects in weekend blasts in the Kherson region in southern Ukraine that downed electricity pylons serving Crimea, leaving almost two million people without power. The Ukrainian government responded Monday by imposing a temporary ban on trucks ferrying goods to and from Crimea. Authorities in Crimea have banned Mr. Djemilev from returning until 2019.
