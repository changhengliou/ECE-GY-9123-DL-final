It appears unaccompanied men won't be joining the 25,000 refugees coming into Canada this year. 

Only women, children and families will be accepted into Canada as part of the federal government's refugee plan, according to the CBC who cited unnamed sources.

According to the report, ongoing security concerns have prompted officials to exclude unaccompanied men seeking asylum.

CTV News previously reported that priority would be given to families and multiple residences at Canadian Forces Base Kingston are being emptied to accommodate a wave of refugees.

According to an internal memo obtained by CTV, soldiers and military personnel have been asked to vacate their barracks by Nov. 30.

The memo, however, does not indicate where military personnel will be placed.

Debbie Douglas, the executive director of the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, told CTV that refugees who come to Ontario will spend about six weeks in a refugee centre.

Refugee centres will be located in cities across Ontario, including Toronto, Ottawa, Kitchener-Waterloo, Windsor and London.

"At the refugee centre... you identify what services they require, what kind of emergency support they may need, be that mental health, be that physical, primary health care. You get a sense of what language supports they might need," Douglas said.

"You begin to work with them to find more permanent housing."
